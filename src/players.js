        playerBio: "He rules with an iron fist, but can his continued suppression of free speech and liberties continue for another tour? Almost certainly (long may it continue). Begrudgingly voted PP last tour, the weight of expectation falls on the Chairman’s shoulders once again. But, will the trauma of childbirth and having to raise an heir play havoc with his golf?",

        playerBio: "Stockholm has worked wonders for the spreadsheets but the facade of not wanting to be a European but wanting to be one continues. Quality on the course, CO’B will once again be a difficult man to stop. Questions surrounding his temperament persist, can he weather the incoming oväder? A “badger off” feels inevitable and may prove to be his kryptonite.",

        playerBio: "Has attempted a strong rebrand in recent years. Gone are the days of blizzards and being a part time toilet attendant. Or so he says. This combucha swigging all-American has seen huge gains in his golf and will look to rekindle last years form. Some demons remain and an early show down with Dilly may trigger some PTSD.",

        playerBio: "After a splendid virgin tour during his freshman year, Daddy is back. A fruitful spring break has seen this whale of a man replenished and raring to go. Simmering passion burns and he’ll look to exert his sizeable presence on any unassuming victim. Can this man finally manage to get the Europeans excited that he’s on tour? Its certainly looking an uphill task.",

        playerBio: "Will be licking his lips at the prospect of sinking his teeth into another tour. With a healthy appetite for drama, controversy is never far away. Can Jack break free from the constraints placed on him by his overbearing Chairman and Captain? The well orchestrated #bekind campaign worked wonders on the course but subdued the self titled party boy off it last year. Would be wise to leave the driver at home.",

        playerBio: "Yank captain and don’t we know it. Brash, bold and loves a 19th hole or two. A real coming of age tour awaits. Not known for his composure or pressure handling skills and prone to a crumble a la Bawburgh, he will need to find some Sea Shepherd activists in and amongst his team.",

Well, it would appear contrary to many other fathers that having a baby actually enables you to do such things. Frankly, the man is on fire.
